## // Yet Another Weather App :sunny:

An app made with the awesome [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) library, because it's pretty cool.

Based on [Vue-starter template](http://vue-starter.testi.in/), using [Vue.js 2](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) with [Vue Router 2](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router), [Vuex](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex), [Vue Resouce](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-resource) and s'mores.

A stripped down [Bootstrap 4 Alpha](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/) was used for type, grids, and responsive mixins. Everything is [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/), icons are [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/).

[Firebase](http://firebase.google.com/) was used as a back end and [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org/) provides the weather and location data.

### Demo
You might find a not-quite-up-to-date version at [yawa.kunakos.ro](http://yawa.kunakos.ro). See the "about" page!

### Bugs and such
As most experiments, this one can and will blow up in your face. It has been found to work in Chrome 55 (desktop and mobile), Safari 10 (desktop and mobile) and Firefox 50. Dragging doesn't work in IE, and the whole things fails miserably in Opera Mini (which would be pretty bad in the real world). But it's pretty nice in Chrome and Safari, I promise.
